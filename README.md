# Introduction

This is a [Helm](https://helm.sh/) chart for installing Mastodon into a
Kubernetes cluster.  The basic usage is:

1. edit `values.yaml` or create a separate yaml file for custom values
1. `helm dep update`
1. `helm install --namespace mastodon --create-namespace my-mastodon ./ -f path/to/additional/values.yaml`

This chart is tested with k8s 1.21+ and helm 3.8.0+.

# Configuration

The variables that _must_ be configured are:

- password and keys in the `mastodon.secrets`, `postgresql`, and `redis` groups; if
  left blank, some of those values will be autogenerated, but will not persist
  across upgrades.

- SMTP settings for your mailer in the `mastodon.smtp` group.

If your PersistentVolumeClaim is `ReadWriteOnce` and you're unable to use a S3-compatible service or
run a self-hosted compatible service like [Minio](https://min.io/docs/minio/kubernetes/upstream/index.html)
then you need to set the pod affinity so the web and sidekiq pods are scheduled to the same node.

Example configuration:
```yaml
podAffinity:
  requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
    - labelSelector:
        matchExpressions:
          - key: app.kubernetes.io/part-of
            operator: In
            values:
              - rails
      topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
```

# Administration

You can run [admin CLI](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/tootctl/) commands in the web deployment.

```bash
kubectl -n mastodon exec -it deployment/mastodon-web -- bash
tootctl accounts modify admin --reset-password
```

or
```bash
kubectl -n mastodon exec -it deployment/mastodon-web -- tootctl accounts modify admin --reset-password
```

# Missing features

Currently this chart does _not_ support:

- Hidden services
- Swift

# Upgrading

Because database migrations are managed as a Job separate from the Rails and
Sidekiq deployments, itâ€™s possible they will occur in the wrong order.  After
upgrading Mastodon versions, it may sometimes be necessary to manually delete
the Rails and Sidekiq pods so that they are recreated against the latest
migration.
